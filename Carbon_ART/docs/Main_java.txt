2. Imports
import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.stage.Stage;


Application → base class for every JavaFX app

Stage → the main window of your app (like a browser window)

3. Class Declaration
public class Main extends Application {


This means:

Your Main class inherits JavaFX Application.

It must override the start() method.

4. main() Method
public static void main(String[] args) {
    launch(args);
}


What this does:

JVM starts here.

launch() tells JavaFX to start its application thread.

After starting, JavaFX automatically calls your start() method.

So:

main() → launch() → JavaFX starts → calls start(stage)

5. start(Stage stage) method
@Override
public void start(Stage stage) {
    BrowserUI ui = new BrowserUI();
    ui.start(stage);
}


This is the heart of JavaFX startup.

What happens here:

👉 Step 1 — Create your browser UI class
BrowserUI ui = new BrowserUI();


You created the object that handles:

Toolbar

Tabs

WebView

Bookmarks

Full browser layout

So BrowserUI is the actual browser, not Main.

In simple kid-friendly words:

Main.java is the door.
BrowserUI is the entire house.
Main opens the door and tells JavaFX to walk into your browser UI
